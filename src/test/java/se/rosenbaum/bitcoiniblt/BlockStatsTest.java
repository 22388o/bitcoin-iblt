/**
 * What do I want to accomplish?
 *
 * 1. Find good values of key, value and hashSum sizes
 * 2. Find a good number of hash functions (k)
 * 3. Find heuristics for selecting number of cells (m)
 *
 * Loose thoughts:
 *
 * If we double the the value size, we could roughly half the number of cells, If so, the
 * total size of the iblt will decrease by (oldCellCount / 2) * (hashSumSize + keySize).
 *
 * If the value size is increased to something larger than or equal to 100000/256 bytes ~= 391 bytes
 * then we can use a single byte as indexCounter, since the maximum tx size is 100000 B. But
 * I haven't seen this limit anywhere else than in Gavin's paper on O(1) block propagation and in
 * bitcoinj:s Transaction.MAX_STANDARD_TX_SIZE.
 *
 * We probably want a value size less than say, 270, since most transactions seems to be between 200 and 270 bytes.
 * Then they seem to jump up to about 380 bytes and upwards from there. At least on my sample of the latest
 * 10000 transactions in the block chain from block 0000000000000000152c3db4fe011716c4e5d41e44089e1da9d7d64917bb5011
 * and backwards
 *
 * How do we make experiments on this? I guess there are already good research done on sizing k and m. So I suppose
 * we should focus on the key, value and hashSum sizes. I guess our goal is to make the iblt as small as possible
 * while still keeping the probability of failure very low (<10*e-6).
